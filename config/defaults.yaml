Tmux:
  # tmux is a terminal multiplexer. This terminal emulator supports tmux
  # integration via the tmux control plane.
  # You can also disable tmux here and set `tmux` as the default shell if you
  # would prefer to use the vanilla tmux UI.
  # If `tmux` executable is not in $PATH then this terminal emulator will
  # revert to the $SHELLs defined below
  Enabled: true

# If tmux is not available, then default to the following $SHELLs instead
Shell:
  Default: [murex]
  Fallback: [$SHELL]

Terminal:
  # ScrollbackHistory is the size of the scrollback buffer.
  # Value is number of lines

  # Close the scrollback (ie jump back to end of history) if a key is pressed
  # while in the history scrollback view
  ScrollbackCloseKeyPress: true

  # This controls how often a carriage return (\n) will force the window to
  # update. The lower the number, the smoother the scrolling but at the cost
  # of terminal performance and system requirements.
  # Value is number of lines (ie number of carriage returns or \n) to count
  # before a forced update.
  # `0` updates per character, which is smooth but slow
  # `-1` updates per page, which is fast.
  # Window.RefreshInterval also affects window updates
  # This value can also be overwritten by CSI ?4l and CSI ?4h (DECSCLM)

  # RefreshInterval is how long to wait between forced window updates.
